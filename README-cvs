These notes intend to help people working on the CVS versions of a2ps.
Only the sources are installed in the CVS repository (to ease the
maintenance, merges etc.), therefore you will have to the maintainer
tools we depend upon:

- Automake 1.6.3

- Autoconf 2.57
  (ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/autoconf/autoconf-2.57.tar.gz)

- Gettext 0.11.5

- Libtool 1.4.2a
  I'm using the Debian package.

- Gperf 2.7.2

Only building the initial full source tree will be a bit painful,
later, a plain `cvs update -P & make' should be sufficient.

* First CVS checkout

Obviously, if you are reading these notes, you did manage to check out
Bison from CVS.  For the records, you will find all the relevant
information on:

	http://savannah.gnu.org/cvs/?group_id=56

The next step is asking the installation of all the missing files:

	$ ./bootstrap

At this point, there should be no difference between your local copy,
and the CVS master copy:

	$ cvs diff

should output no difference, except maybe the date in po/*.po files.

Enjoy!
