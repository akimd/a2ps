[NAME]
texi2dvi4a2ps \- Compile Texinfo and LaTeX files to DVI or PDF

[SEE ALSO]
texi2dvi4a2ps is exactly the same script as texi2dvi, part of the
package GNU Texinfo.  It is used by a2ps when delegating LaTeX and
Texinfo files.  Instead of checking whether the version of texi2dvi
which is installed is recent enough, it is more convenient for the
users that a2ps is shipped with the version of texi2dvi it requires.
